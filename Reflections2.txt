What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to 
do it?
When you initialise a repository, it creates the folder .git, which
contains all the tracked data and commit histories. 
We need to do it so we can use all the cool git features within that
folder and to track any associated files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains all changes/files that will be added to the
repository in the next commit. The working directory is just the 
folder we are currently in.
It makes sense that changes are not commited automatically, but that
you can choose which you want to do. That way things that already 
exist can be commited in stages, rather than as a big bundle.
